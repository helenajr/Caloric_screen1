caloric_tidy.csv is the original data sent by Vicki

There are 2 word documents and R scripts. V1 is plain ROC analysis without modelling.
V2 is the same analysis using data from the model. There are some bits of terrible code in the v2 R script and it will need to be gone through manually to obtain some values.

caloric_markdown.R and Rmd are the first attempt at a regression model which was sent to Antonio. Using glm() function instead of rms package.

Resources are helpful resources for regression modelling.

caloric_markdown3.Rmd goes through many of the steps involved in model fitting and explains validation and calibration.
